| Variable                  | Description                                | Default            |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| PORT                      | Server port                                | 3000               |
| NODE_ENV                  | Node environment                           | development        |
| MONGODB_URI               | MongoDB connection string                  | -                  |
| PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH | Path to Chromium/Chrome executable         | -                  |
| ADMIN_PHONE               | Admin WhatsApp number (with @c.us suffix)  | 91xxxxxxxxxx@c.us  |
| WEBHOOK_URL               | Webhook URL for incoming messages          | n8n webhook url    |
| CLIENT_LIFETIME           | Client lifetime in milliseconds            | 300000 (5 minutes) |
| MESSAGE_DELAY             | Delay between message sends (ms)           | 1000               |
| MAX_RETRIES               | Maximum retry attempts for failed messages | 3                  |
| RETRY_DELAY               | Delay between retry attempts (ms)          | 5000               |

For Docker deployments, the container automatically installs and configures Chromium, so you don't need to set `PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH` manually.

## üîÑ Integration with n8n

Setting up this gateway with n8n is straightforward:

1. Deploy this WhatsApp Gateway using the instructions above
2. In n8n, create a new workflow
3. Add an HTTP Request node to send messages:
   - Method: POST
   - URL: http://your-gateway:3000/api/whatsapp/send
   - Body: JSON with message details (as shown in API endpoints)
4. To receive messages:
   - Create a Webhook node in n8n
   - Copy the webhook URL
   - Set this URL as the WEBHOOK_URL in your gateway's environment
   - Incoming WhatsApp messages will trigger your n8n workflow

This gives you a **completely free WhatsApp integration** for your n8n workflows!
